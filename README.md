phonegap-feed-reader
====================

a PhoneGap Feed Reader (only iOS so far but this will support iOS, Android, FFOS, Windows and BBOS if all goes well)

nowhere near complete as of yet

so far I have a pretty good promises-style check to see if a file exists using PhoneGap API
Notifications (native alerts) are implemented
